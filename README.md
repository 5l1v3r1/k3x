# k3dv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inercia/k3dv.svg?token=FPnnbB3C3dSrB6gCVFnw&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inercia/k3dv)

k3dv is a graphical user interface for [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d),
making it trivial to have your own local [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster(s).

k3dv is perfect for:

* developers that want to create/destroy clusters in a couple of seconds.
* anyone who wants to learn about Kubernetes.

k3dv goals are:

* to create/switch-to/destroy Kubernetes clusters easily.
* to trigger the most important operations with global shortcuts.
* to reduce the learning curve of using Kubernetes.

## Pre-requisites

* Some Linux distribution where you can install
  [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/) packages.
* A **Docker** daemon. It can be both a local or a remote one... but things
  are easier with a local one.

## Installation

* Using the Flatpak provided in [our releases page](https://github.com/inercia/k3dv/releases).

* Installing from the [Flathub](https://flathub.org): _comming soon!_

## Documentation

* [Preferences](docs/user-manual-preferences.md).
* [Creating a new cluster](docs/user-manual-creating-a-new-cluster.md).
